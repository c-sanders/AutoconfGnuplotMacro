Overview
--------

This package doesn't need to compile or build anything. All it really needs to do, is to install a
few files into their correct locations. One of the files that needs to be installed is a Python file
which is called;

  runFfmpeg.py

Once it is installed in its correct location, it can be run by invoking the Python Interpreter on
it, i.e.;

  > python runFfmpeg.py


Configuration and installation
------------------------------

For instructions on how to configure and install this packge, pleaase refer to the file which is
named INSTALL.

Alternatively, if you can't be bothered reading the INSTALL file, then you might be able to get away
with simply running the following two commands from the command line.

  > configure
  > make install

The first command will run this packge's configure script, while the second command will install all
of the necessary files into their correct locations. As was mentioned above, this package doesn't
need to compile or build anything. This is the reason why you don't need run the make command
without any explicit target, that is;

  > make

If the configure script cannot find an installed copy of the ffmpeg command, then you might need to
tell it where it can find one. In this case, you will need to pass the --with-ffmpeg option to the
configure script when it is invoked, such as in the following example;

  > configure --with-ffmpeg=/home/foo/bin/ffmpeg

If this doesn't work either, then your copy of ffmpeg might be too old, or you might not have a copy
of ffmpeg installed at all :(
